# Compute Statistics

Here we compute statistics for a bunch of measurements arriving from a sensor.

This project uses the Xunit framework to test functionality.
[See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test)
for details.

## Pass the tests

The code is not complete and doesn't even compile.
Have a look at the tests to know our intention.
Design the return type accordingly.
You need to design a test for an error condition as well.

Take care not to leave behind any compiler warnings in your solution.

## Add test for invalid measurements

What if some of the measurements are invalid? Invalid measurements are represented by NaN.

Add a test case to supply invalid mesurements and check the results.
